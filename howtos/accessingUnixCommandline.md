You have several options for UNIX command-line access. You'll need to choose one of these and get it working.

### Mac OS:

Open a Terminal by going to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal

### Windows:

1.  You may be able to use the Ubuntu bash shell available in Windows.

    Your PC must be running a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Anniversary Update or later (build 1607+).

    Please see these links for more information:

2. There's an older program called cygwin that provides a UNIX command-line interface.

Note that when you install Git on Windows, you will get Git Bash. While you can use this to control Git, the functionality is limited so this will not be enough for general UNIX command-line access for the course.

### Linux:

If you have access to a Linux machine, you very likely know how to access a terminal.

### Access via the Statistical Computing Facility

1. With an SCF account (please see the main course page for info on how to get an account), you can login to our various Linux servers and access a bash shell that way. Please see [http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/access](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/access).

2. With an SCF account, you can also access a bash shell via the SCF Jupyterhub interface; please see the JupyterLogin.md instructions. 

### Access via Datahub
