# Homework 3 Notes and Code Review

This section is mostly a focus on reviewing other students solutions, using PS3 
as an example. We'll begin with things that I saw in homeworks, anything that 
didn't make sense to people, and then finish section with the code review.

## PS3 Notes

1. Problem Statements  
You **have to** answer the questions on the homework. Do whatever you'd like beyond 
that, be as creative as you wish, but **you must answer the questions that were asked**.

2. Include Code  
Most people include it as they go along, that's fine.  
If you find that messy, put an appendix at the end with all of the function definitions.  
This applies to code for plots as well.

3. Bonus/Extra Credit  
This is something additional, above and beyond the basic homework.  
Repeating the analysis already performed, but with different parameters, is not 
novel. 

4. Plots and Comments  
Plots need to have a title, axis labels, and a key if there are several types of data.  
Code and comment lines should be ~80 characters in length.  
e.g.
    ```{r, eval = TRUE}

5. Object Initialization, Atomic Access, and Growth  
There are many ways to initialize objects in R, but there are more and less 
correct methods to do it.
    ```{r, eval = TRUE}
    ####################
    ## Object Initialization
    ####################
    n = 10000
    
    # integers
    x1 <- rep(as.integer(NA), n)
    x2 <- rep(1L, n)
    x3 <- c(1:n)
    x3.5 <- 1:n
    x4 <- vector(mode = "integer", length = n)
    x5 <- integer(length = n)
    
    # double
    x6 <- double(length = n)
    x6.5 <- numeric(length = n)
    
    # logical
    x7 <- logical(length = n)
    
    # lists
    #  There is not a good way to do this, sorry
    x9 <- vector(mode = "list", length = n)
    
    # benchmark for fun
    microbenchmark::microbenchmark("repNA" = rep(as.integer(NA), n),
                                   "rep" = rep(0L, n),
                                   "repInt" = rep.int(x = 0L,times = n),
                                   "int()" = integer(length = n),
                                   "vec()" = vector(mode = "integer", length = n),
                                   times = 1000)
    ```

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ####################
    ## Object replacement/access
    ####################
    # run this in TERMINAL!!!
    x1 <- integer(length = n)
    .Internal(inspect(x1))
    x1 <- vapply(X = 1:n, FUN = as.integer, FUN.VALUE = integer(length = 1))
    .Internal(inspect(x1)) # this will be different!!
    x1[1:n] <- vapply(X = 1:n, FUN = as.integer, FUN.VALUE = integer(length = 1))
    .Internal(inspect(x1)) # this will be the same
    ```
\newpage

    ```{r, eval = TRUE, hold = TRUE}
    ####################
    ## Growing Objects
    ####################
    # Initialize
    myList <- list()
    myVec <- numeric(length = 1)
    
    # check length
    cat("Length of list is:", length(myList),
        "\nLength of vector is:", length(myVec))

    # loop
    for(i in 1:n){
      myList[[i]] <- "HAHAHA, I'm growing!"
      myVec[i] <- as.integer(i)
      # effectively the same as append() or c(old, new)
    }
    
    # check length
    cat("Length of list is:", length(myList),
        "\nLength of vector is:", length(myVec))
    ```

6. Vectorizing  
"Vectorizing" in R implies using functions that operate in parallel over certain objects.
R is vectorized in many operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). 
Many functions have built-in vectorization as well, make sure to check the function 
documentation.
    ```{r, eval = TRUE, hold = TRUE}
    ####################
    ## vectorized division
    ####################
    x <- 1:100
    y <- 100:1
    
    mHold <- mapply(FUN = "/", x, y)
    dHold <- x/y
    
    all.equal(mHold, dHold)
    identical(mHold, dHold)
    
    ####################
    ## vectorized multinomial
    ####################
    myprobs <- matrix(data = c(0.1,0.1,0.8, 1/3,1/3,1/3), nrow = 2, byrow = T)
    
    set.seed(0)
    apHold <- t(apply(X = myprobs, MARGIN = 1, FUN = rmultinom, n = 1, size = 100))
    
    set.seed(0)
    edHold <- extraDistr::rmnom(n = 2, size = 100, prob = myprobs)
    
    all.equal(apHold, edHold)
    identical(apHold, edHold) # why false?
    
    # short benchmark
    microbenchmark::microbenchmark("apply" = apply(X = myprobs, MARGIN = 1,
                                                   FUN = rmultinom, n = 1, size = 100),
                                   "vector" = extraDistr::rmnom(n = 2, size = 100,
                                                                prob = myprobs),
                                   times = 100)
    ```

## PS3 Code Review

Today we will practice paired code review for PS3. In order for this to be of benefit, 
you will need to be as honest with your partner as possible. If something is actually 
hard to follow, tell them! If you thought that something they did was clever, 
also tell them!

### Procedure  
First, we will break into pairs of 2. This can be accomplished in one of two ways:

1. You pair up randomly with someone you don't know
2. You count off and I draw numbers for you  
    * e.g., `matrix(data = sample(x = 1:n, size = n, replace = FALSE), ncol = 2)`

Second, you will each spend 15-20 minutes reading each other's code while your partner 
is available to answer questions you have about their work. I will float around 
and can make any clarifying points. 

Finally, each of you will fill out [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xq77Uru0DqZyRTZbQcBywDbEE3uOS31h2dgvJmksyp4/edit) 
(also here https://tinyurl.com/statps3rev) google form summarizing the differences 
between yours and your partners work, noting anything that was particularly novel 
to you.  

### Some Guiding Questions

1. Is the code visually easy to break apart? Can you see the entire body of the 
functions without scrolling up/down left/right? The general rule-of-thumb is no 
more than 80 in either direction (80 character width, 80 lines. The first restriction 
should be practiced more religiously)

2. Are the data structures easy to parse? Do you understand what information is in 
which objects? Is the type of data appropriate? 

3. Are the functions easy to parse? Is it clear what they are doing, what information 
is being passed to each function, and what the return value/objects are?

4. Look at the regex. Are there any edge cases that were missed? Was anything handled 
particularly well? Any novel expressions that you didn't think of?

5. Look at the plots. Are they well labeled? Is it easy to read information from them? 
Do they provide an assurance that the code is running correctly? Was there anything 
particularly neat about your partner's solution to the bonus?

6. EXTRA. Look at problem 2, compare/contrast your approaches to OOP. Explain the 
logic behind your design.
