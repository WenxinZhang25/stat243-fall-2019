Scientific/algorithmic complexity vs code complexity and how they pertain to 
human understanding of code.

Can code be self-explanatory?
    At what level? (ie, expert vs noob)
    Does it depend on field of expertise? (ie, biologist vs statistician)

Open-source vs proprietary software?
    What about reliability?
    Cost of experiments. (mice are expensive)
    What is several pieces of software are used?

When do you start using best practices on a project?
    What if the code will only be used internally?
    What if it grows beyond what you imagined later?
    How to balance time/money on development vs documentation?

Who is responsible for ensuring reproducibility or replicability?
    The journal/editors?
    The community?
    How are authors encouraged to adhere to standards?
    Where is data stored? With the paper? The journal? The authors?
