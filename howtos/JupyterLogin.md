0) You need to be logged into AirBears2 or EduRoam wireless. You cannot use CalVisitor. To use AirBears2 based on your CalNet ID, see the instructions at the bottom before proceeding to the next step.

1) Go to https://jupyter.stat.berkeley.edu

2) Login using your SCF username and password. This is NOT your CalNet information. If you have a temporary account (i.e., if you've gotten a paper account sheet from Chris), enter the 'Account login name' as the Username and 'Account password' as the Password at the Jupyter Sign in page.

3) Click on 'Start My Server'

4) Under 'Spawner Options' leave all the defaults and just click on 'Spawn'.

5) Click on 'New' in the mid-upper right of the next page. At this point you have several options:

   - 'Terminal' will give you an interactive terminal (bash shell) session.
   - 'RStudio Session' will give you
   - 'Bash' will give you a Jupyter notebook where you enter bash code in the chunks of the notebook. 

6) To end your session entirely, click on the Jupyter browser page/tab and click on the Control Panel button in the upper right. Then choose 'Stop My Server'. Note that simply stopping the Terminal or RStudio session will not terminate your overall session on the remote computer server. Finally press the Logout button in the upper right.
